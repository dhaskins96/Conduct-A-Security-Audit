<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I conducted an internal IT audit for a business using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, reviewing the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment to assess risks and compliance. I completed a controls and compliance checklist to help secure their infrastructure and ensure regulatory adherence for online payments and E.U. operations.

<h2>Scenario</h2>
Botium Toys, a small U.S. toy business with a growing online presence, is facing increased IT demands to support global customers. Concerned about compliance and operational risks, the IT manager initiated an internal audit to identify vulnerabilities and improve security. Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the audit will assess the company’s infrastructure, focusing on mitigating risks and ensuring compliance with online payment processing and E.U. regulations.

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.
