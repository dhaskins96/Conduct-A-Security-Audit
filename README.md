[Risk Assessment Report Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RDQohdLT9qmMhMy6XHlt_7f6lBvbLDx5N-oAyfrdLk0/edit)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I conducted an internal IT audit for a business using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, reviewing the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment to assess risks and compliance. I completed a controls and compliance checklist to help secure their infrastructure and ensure regulatory adherence for online payments and E.U. operations.

<br />

<h2>Scenario</h2>
Botium Toys, a small U.S. toy business with a growing online presence, is facing increased IT demands to support global customers. Concerned about compliance and operational risks, the IT manager initiated an internal audit to identify vulnerabilities and improve security. Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the audit will assess the company’s infrastructure, focusing on mitigating risks and ensuring compliance with online payment processing and E.U. regulations.
